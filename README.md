## 🧠 Concept

*Trashborn* is an indie roguelike inspired by games like *The Binding of Isaac*, mixing intense combat, exploration, and platforming mechanics. Dive into a twisted version of hell, where each level is ruled by one of the Seven Deadly Sins — each with unique designs, behaviors, and psychological symbolism.

- **Gluttony**  
- **Greed**  
- **Lust**  
- **Wrath**
